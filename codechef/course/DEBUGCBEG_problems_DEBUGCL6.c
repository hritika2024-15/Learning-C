/*Runtime error due to 0 used as a divisor
Task
There is a sample code present in IDE, which inputs two number and prints their division.
If you run the code for a test case like 3 0 you will get the runtime error.
To fix it, add an if condition which checks if the value of b is 0 and output infinity directly. Otherwise output the result of division.*/
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    if(b==0){
        printf("infinity");
    }
    else{

    printf("%d\n", a / b);
}
}
